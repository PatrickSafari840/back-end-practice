# back-end-practice
This project implemented a basic web application. It allows users to submit comments via an HTML form. These comments are processed on the server-side, inserted into a database, and then retrieved to populate a dynamic 'View Comments' page. This project aimed to solidify my understanding of database connectivity and web application development.
